title: Change type
description: A change type operation changes the type of a column.
---

## Structure

```yaml
alter_column:
  table: table name
  column: column name
  type: new type of column
  up: SQL expression
  down: SQL expression
```

Use the `up` SQL expression to do data conversion from the old column type to the new type. In the old schema version, the column will have its old data type; in the new version the column will have its new type.

Use the `down` SQL expression to do data conversion in the other direction; from the new data type back to the old.

## Examples

Change the type of the `rating` column on the `reviews` table:
