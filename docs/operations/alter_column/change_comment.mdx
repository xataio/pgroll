title: Change comment
description: A change comment operation changes the comment on a column.
---

## Structure

```json
{
  "alter_column": {
    "table": "table name",
    "column": "column name",
    "comment": "new comment for column" | null,
    "up": "SQL expression",
    "down": "SQL expression"
  }
}
```

The comment is added directly to the column on migration start.

## Examples

An alter column migration performs many operations, including setting a comment: 

<ExampleSnippet example="35_alter_column_multiple.json" language="json" />

To remove a comment from a column set `comment` to `NULL`:

<ExampleSnippet example="36_set_comment_to_null.json" language="json" />
