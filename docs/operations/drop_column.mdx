description: A drop column operation drops a column from an existing table.

## Structure

<YamlJsonTabs>
```yaml
drop_column:
  table: name of table
  column: name of column to drop
  down: SQL expression

```
```json
{
  "drop_column": {
    "table": "name of table",
    "column": "name of column to drop",
    "down": "SQL expression"
  }
}
```
</YamlJsonTabs>

The `down` field above is required in order to backfill the previous version of the schema during an active migration.

## Examples

### Drop a column

Drop a column - if a new row is inserted against the new schema without a `price` column, the old schema `price` column will be set to `0`.
