## Structure

```json
{
  "rename_table": {
    "from": "old column name",
    "to": "new column name"
  }
}
```

The table is accessible by its old name in the old version of the schema, and by its new name in the new version of the schema.

The table itself is renamed on migration completion.

## Examples
