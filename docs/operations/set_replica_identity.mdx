title: Set replica identity
description: A set replica identity operation sets the replica identity for a table.
---

## Structure

```json
{
  "set_replica_identity": {
    "table": "name of the table",
    "identity": {
      "type": "full | default | nothing | index"
      "index": "name of the index, if type is 'index'"
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  A **set replica identity** operation is applied directly to the underlying
  table on migration start. This means that both versions of the table exposed
  in the old and new version schemas will have the new replica identity set.
</Warning>
