title: Drop multi-column constraint
description: A drop constraint operation drops a multi-column constraint from an existing table.
---

## Structure

Only `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY`, and `UNIQUE` constraints can be dropped.

<YamlJsonTabs>
```yaml
drop_multicolumn_constraint:
  table: name of table
  name: name of constraint to drop
  up:
    column1: up SQL expressions for each column covered by the constraint
    ...
  down:
    column1: down SQL expressions for each column covered by the constraint
    ...
```
```json
{
  "drop_multicolumn_constraint": {
    "table": "name of table",
    "name": "name of constraint to drop",
    "up": {
      "column1": "up SQL expressions for each column covered by the constraint",
      ...
    },
    "down": {
      "column1": "down SQL expressions for each column covered by the constraint",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```
</YamlJsonTabs>

This operation can also be used to drop single-column constraints and replaces the deprecated (#drop-constraint) operation.

An `up` and `down` SQL expression is required for each column covered by the constraint, and no other column names are permitted. For example, when dropping a constraint covering columns `a` and `b` the `up` and `down` fields should look like:

<YamlJsonTabs>
```yaml
up:
  a: up SQL expression for column a
  b: up SQL expression for column b
down:
  a: down SQL expression for column a
  b: down SQL expression for column b
```
```json
{
  "up": {
    "a": "up SQL expression for column a",
    "b": "up SQL expression for column b",
  },
  "down": {
    "a": "down SQL expression for column a",
    "b": "down SQL expression for column b",
  }
}
```
</YamlJsonTabs>

The new versions of the columns will no longer have the constraint, but in the old view of the table the columns will still be covered by the constraint; the `down` expressions should therefore be used to ensure that the combination of values meets the constraint being dropped.

## Examples

### Drop a `CHECK` constraint

Drop a `CHECK` constraint defined on the `tickets` table.
