title: Writing up and down migrations
description: Guide to writing up and down migrations
---

In this guide, we will learn how to write `up` and `down` migrations in your `pgroll` operations. First, we are looking at how `up` and `down` migrations work. Then we will look at a few examples.

## What is an `up` and `down` migration of a `pgroll` operation?

Most `pgroll` migrations include `up` and `down` migrations. When `pgroll` migrates tables, it creates `up` and `down` triggers. `up` triggers backfill existing columns with the new values during `start` phase. They also run when you insert new rows into the old schema version or when you update any of the existing rows in the old schema version. `down` triggers run when you insert new rows or update existing rows in the new schema.

The expressions in `up` and `down` are PL/pgSQL assignments executed by the triggers. Thus, these are evaluated as an SQL `SELECT` statement.

## Examples

Now let's look at a few examples. We are performing different migrations on this table:

```
postgres=# \d employee
                                 Table "public.employee"
 Column |       Type       | Collation | Nullable |               Default
--------+------------------+-----------+----------+--------------------------------------
 id     | integer          |           | not null | nextval('employee_id_seq'::regclass)
 name   | text             |           | not null |
 nick   | text             |           | not null |
 email  | text             |           |          |
 salary | double precision |           | not null |
 bio    | text             |           |          |
Indexes:
    "employee_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)

```

With the following records:

```
 id | name  | nick |     email      | salary  |                 bio
----+-------+------+----------------+---------+-------------------------------------
  1 | Alice | al   | al@company.com |  5000.5 | hi, i am al
  2 | Bob   | rob  |                |  5400.5 | i am bob aka rob. i love gardening.
  3 | Carol | cat  |                | 6500.75 |
```

### Keep the value from the application

We are adding a new check constraint to the table to make sure all first names are capitalized. We inspected our table and know
that the check is on the application side. Thus, all data coming from it are valid.

<YamlJsonTabs>
```yaml
operations:
 - create_constraint:
    name: capitalized_name
    table: employee
    type: check
    columns:
     - name
    check: name = INITCAP(name)
    up:
     name: name
    down:
     name: name
```
```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "create_constraint": {
        "name": "capitalized_name",
        "table": "employee",
        "type": "check",
        "columns": [
          "name"
        ],
        "check": "name = INITCAP(name)",
        "up": {
          "name": "name"
        },
        "down": {
          "name": "name"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</YamlJsonTabs>

Notice that both `up` and `down` migrations are set to `name` for `name` column. Thus, `pgroll` preserves the values in the column `name`.

So after the migraton, the rows stay the same:

```
 name  | nick |     email      | salary  |                 bio
-------+------+----------------+---------+-------------------------------------
 Alice | al   | al@company.com |  5000.5 | hi, i am al
 Bob   | rob  |                |  5400.5 | i am bob aka rob. i love gardening.
 Carol | cat  |                | 6500.75 |
```

### Convert type

In this example we are changing the type of a column from float to int.

Each person's salary is stored in a float. We are converting the `salary` column from float to integer using `trunc`.

<YamlJsonTabs>
```yaml
operations:
 - alter_column:
    table: employee
    column: salary
    type: integer
    up: trunc(salary)
    down: salary
```
```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "alter_column": {
        "table": "employee",
        "column": "salary",
        "type": "integer",
        "up": "trunc(salary)",
        "down": "salary"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
</YamlJsonTabs>

After the migration, the `salary` column contains only integers.

```
 name  | nick |     email      | salary |                 bio
-------+------+----------------+--------+-------------------------------------
 Alice | al   | al@company.com |   5000 | hi, i am al
 Bob   | rob  |                |   5400 | i am bob aka rob. i love gardening.
 Carol | cat  |                |   6500 |
```

### Add a static value

We are adding a new column that cannot be null named `location`. We are setting it to `New York` using the `up` expression.

<YamlJsonTabs>
```yaml
operations:
 - add_column:
     table: employee
     up: '''New York'''
     column:
       name: location
       type: text
       nullable: false

```
```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "add_column": {
        "table": "employee",
        "up": "'New York'",
        "column": {
          "name": "location",
          "type": "text",
          "nullable": false
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</YamlJsonTabs>

The table is backfilled:

```
 id | nick |     email      |                 bio                 | name  | salary | location
----+------+----------------+-------------------------------------+-------+--------+----------
  1 | al   | al@company.com | hi, i am al                         | Alice |   5000 | New York
  2 | rob  |                | i am bob aka rob. i love gardening. | Bob   |   5400 | New York
  3 | cat  |                |                                     | Carol |   6500 | New York
```

### Add a value if column is not set

We are adding a not null constraint to the `email` column. If the `email` column is not set, we are concatenating the column `nick` and `@company.com`.

<YamlJsonTabs>
```yaml
operations:
 - alter_column:
    table: employee
    column: email
    nullable: false
    up: SELECT CASE WHEN email IS NULL THEN nick || '@company.com' ELSE email END
    down: email

```
```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "alter_column": {
        "table": "employee",
        "column": "email",
        "nullable": false,
        "up": "SELECT CASE WHEN email IS NULL THEN nick || '@company.com' ELSE email END",
        "down": "email"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</YamlJsonTabs>

After the migration is complete, everyone will have an email address:

```
 name  | nick |     email       | salary |                 bio
-------+------+-----------------+--------+-------------------------------------
 Alice | al   | al@company.com  |   5000 | hi, i am al
 Bob   | rob  | rob@company.com |   5400 | i am bob aka rob. i love gardening.
 Carol | cat  | cat@company.com |   6500 |
```

### Add a value based on column contents using an SQL function

Now let's add another constraint to the table. This time we make sure that everyone has a few words in their bio. If the user has a too short bio, we are appending a random string.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION random_bio(integer)
    RETURNS TEXT AS
    $$
        SELECT array_to_string(
            ARRAY (
                SELECT substring(
                    'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
                    FROM (ceil(random()*26))::int FOR 1
                )
                FROM generate_series(1, $1)
            ),
            ''
)
$$
LANGUAGE sql VOLATILE;
```

Then we can call this function from the `up` migration:
* if `bio` is null, we add a constant `'this employee did not provide a bio'`
* if `bio` is shorter than 15 characters, we generate random characters to reach 15 characters using the function `random_bio`
* if `bio` is longer than 100 characters, we truncate `bio` and add `...` to the end

The complete migration is the following:

<YamlJsonTabs>
```yaml
operations:
 - create_constraint:
    name: limited_required_bio
    table: employee
    type: check
    columns:
     - bio
    check: length(bio) > 15 AND length(bio) < 100
    up:
     bio: >
       CASE
         WHEN bio IS NULL THEN 'this employee did not provide a bio'
         WHEN length(bio) <= 15 THEN bio || SELECT random_bio(16-length(bio))
         WHEN length(bio) >= 100 THEN left(bio, 96) || '...'
         ELSE bio
       END
    down:
     bio: bio

```
```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "create_constraint": {
        "name": "limited_required_bio",
        "table": "employee",
        "type": "check",
        "columns": [
          "bio"
        ],
        "check": "length(bio) > 15 AND length(bio) < 100",
        "up": {
          "bio": "CASE WHEN bio IS NULL THEN 'this employee did not provide a bio' WHEN length(bio) <= 15 THEN bio || SELECT random_bio(16-length(bio)) WHEN length(bio) >= 100 THEN left(bio, 96) || '...' ELSE bio END"
        },
        "down": {
          "bio": "bio"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</YamlJsonTabs>

The `bio` column for `Alice` now contains extra 5 characters (`oivgd`) after the migration is complete:

```
 name  | nick |     email       | salary |                 bio
-------+------+-----------------+--------+-------------------------------------
 Alice | al   | al@company.com  |   5000 | hi, i am aloivgd
 Bob   | rob  | rob@company.com |   5400 | i am bob aka rob. i love gardening.
 Carol | cat  | cat@company.com |   6500 | this employee did not provide a bio
```
