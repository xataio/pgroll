## Command

The `pgroll latest` command has two subcommands:

- [`pgroll latest schema`](./latest-schema) - prints the latest version schema name
- [`pgroll latest migration`](./latest-migration) - prints the latest migration name  

All subcommands support the `--local` flag to retrieve information from a local directory of migration files instead of the target database.
