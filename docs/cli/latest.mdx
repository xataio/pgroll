description: Prints the latest schema version or migration name in either the target database or a local directory of migration files.

## Command

The `pgroll latest` command has two subcommands:

- `pgroll latest schema` - prints the latest schema version (migration name prefixed with schema name)
- `pgroll latest migration` - prints the latest migration name (without schema prefix)

Both subcommands support the `--local` flag to retrieve the latest version from a local directory of migration files instead of the target database.

### Schema Command

#### Database

Assuming that the [example migrations](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/tree/main/examples) have been applied to the `public` schema in the target database, running:

```
$ pgroll latest schema
```

will print the latest schema version in the target database:

```
public_55_add_primary_key_constraint_to_table
```

#### Local

Assuming that the [example migrations](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/tree/main/examples) are on disk in a directory called `examples`, running:

```
$ pgroll latest schema --local examples/
```

will print the latest schema version in the directory:

```
public_55_add_primary_key_constraint_to_table
```

### Migration Command

#### Database

Assuming that the [example migrations](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/tree/main/examples) have been applied to the `public` schema in the target database, running:

```
$ pgroll latest migration
```

will print the latest migration name in the target database:

```
55_add_primary_key_constraint_to_table
```

#### Local

Assuming that the [example migrations](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/tree/main/examples) are on disk in a directory called `examples`, running:

```
$ pgroll latest migration --local examples/
```

will print the latest migration name in the directory:

```
55_add_primary_key_constraint_to_table
```

The exact output will vary as the `examples/` directory is updated.
