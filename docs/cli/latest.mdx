title: Latest
description: Prints the latest schema version in either the target database or a local directory of migration files.
---

## Command

By default, `pgroll latest` prints the latest version in the target database. Use the `--local` flag to print the latest version in a local directory of migration files instead.

In both cases, the `--with-schema` flag can be used to prefix the latest version with the schema name.

### Database

Assuming that the [example migrations](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/tree/main/examples) have been applied to the `public` schema in the target database, running:

```
$ pgroll latest
```

will print the latest version in the target database:

```
45_add_table_check_constraint
```

The exact output will vary as the `examples/` directory is updated.

### Local

Assuming that the [example migrations](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/tree/main/examples) are on disk in a directory called `examples`, running:

```
$ pgroll latest --local examples/
```

will print the latest migration in the directory:

```
45_add_table_check_constraint
```

The exact output will vary as the `examples/` directory is updated.
