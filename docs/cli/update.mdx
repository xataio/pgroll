## Command

```
$ pgroll update {migrations-folder}
```

The `pgroll update` command updates migration files to the latest file format; use it when a new version of `pgroll` contains breaking changes to the migration file JSON/YAML schema.

The optional `--json` flag can be used to write migration files in JSON format instead of YAML.

<Warning>
`pgroll` hasn't reached v1 yet, so we are releasing breaking changes from time to time. Adopting these changes can be painful manually. We suggest you use `pgroll update` to make sure all your local migrations are correct.
</Warning>

### Example for updating migrations in the `migrations` folder

Update all migrations in the `migrations/` folder:

```
$ pgroll update migrations
```
