## Command

```
$ pgroll update {migrations-folder}
```

This command updates all outdated migration files in the selected migrations folder.

The optional `--json` flag can be used to write migration files in JSON.

<Warning>
`pgroll` hasn't reached v1 yet, so we are releasing breaking changes from time to time. Adopting these changes can be painful manually. We suggest you use the subcommand `update` to make sure all your local migrations are correct.
</Warning>

### Example for updating migrations in the folder `migrations`

```
$ pgroll update migrations
```
