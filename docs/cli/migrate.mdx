description: Applies all outstanding migrations from a directory to the target database.

## Command

Assuming that migrations up to and including migration `40_create_enum_type` from the [example migrations](https://github.com/xataio/pgroll/tree/main/examples) directory have been applied, running:

```
$ pgroll migrate examples/
```

will apply migrations from `41_add_enum_column` onwards to the target database.

If the `--complete` flag is passed to `pgroll migrate` the final migration to be applied will be completed. Otherwise the final migration will be left active (started but not completed).
