## Command

```
$ pgroll init
```

This will create a new schema in the database called `pgroll` (or whatever value is specified with the `--pgroll-schema` switch).

The tables and functions in this schema store `pgroll`'s internal state and are not intended to be modified outside of the `pgroll` CLI.
