title: Baseline
description: Create a baseline migration for an existing database schema
---

## Command

```
$ pgroll baseline <version> <target directory>
```

This command creates a baseline migration for an existing database schema. It captures the current schema state without applying any changes, providing a starting point for future migrations.

Use `pgroll baseline` when:
- Starting to use pgroll with an existing database that already has a schema
- You want to consolidate a long migration history into a clean starting point

The command requires two arguments:
1. `version` - The version name for the baseline (e.g., "01_initial_schema")
2. `target directory` - The directory where the placeholder migration file will be written

The optional `--json` flag can be used to write the placeholder migration file in JSON format instead of YAML.

### How it works

When the `pgroll baseline` command is run, it:
1. Captures the current database schema state in pgroll's internal tracking
2. Creates an empty placeholder migration file in the target directory
3. Records the baseline in `pgroll`'s internal state

**Important**: After running the command, you should manually complete the placeholder migration file:
1. Use a tool like `pg_dump` to extract the DDL statements for your schema
2. Copy those statements (CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX, etc.) into the placeholder migration file's raw SQL section
3. This completed migration file can then be used to reconstruct the schema in other environments

Future migrations will build upon this baseline.

<Warning>
Creating a baseline will restart your migration history. The command will prompt for confirmation before proceeding.
</Warning>

### Effects on migration history

Creating a baseline:
- Creates a "reset point" in your migration history
- Previous migrations become part of the baseline and are no longer individually visible
- When using commands like `pull` and `migrate`, only migrations after the most recent baseline are considered

### Examples

#### Create a baseline with default YAML format

```
pgroll baseline 01_initial_schema ./migrations
```

#### Create a baseline with JSON format

```
pgroll baseline 01_initial_schema ./migrations --json
```
