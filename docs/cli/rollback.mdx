## Command

```
$ pgroll rollback
```

This rolls back the currently active migration (an active migration is one that has been started but not yet completed).

Rolling back a `pgroll` migration means removing the new schema version. The old schema version was still present throughout the migration period and does not require modification.

Migrations cannot be rolled back once completed. Attempting to roll back a migration that has already been completed is a no-op.

<Warning>
  Before running `pgroll rollback` ensure that any new versions of applications
  that depend on the new database schema are no longer live. Prematurely running
  `pgroll rollback` can cause downtime of new application instances that depend
  on the new schema.
</Warning>
