title: Status
description: Show the current status of pgroll within a given schema.

## Command

```
$ pgroll status
```

```json
{
  "Schema": "public",
  "Version": "27_drop_unique_constraint",
  "Status": "Complete"
}
```

The status field can be one of the following values:

- `"No migrations"` - no migrations have been applied in this schema yet.
- `"In progress"` - a migration has been started, but not yet completed.
- `"Complete"` - the most recent migration was completed.

The `Version` field gives the name of the latest schema version.

If a migration is `In progress` the schemas for both the latest version indicated by the `Version` field and the previous version will exist in the database.

If a migration is `Complete` only the latest version of the schema will exist in the database.

The top-level `--schema` flag can be used to view the status of `pgroll` in a different schema:

```
$ pgroll status --schema schema_a
```

```json
{
  "Schema": "schema_a",
  "Version": "01_create_tables",
  "Status": "Complete"
}
```
