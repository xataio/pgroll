## Command

```
$ pgroll start sql/03_add_column.yaml
```

This starts the migration defined in the `sql/03_add_column.yaml` file.

After starting a migration there will be two schema versions in the database; one for the old schema before the migration (e.g. `public_02_create_table`) and one for the new version with the schema changes (e.g. `public_03_add_column`). Each of these schemas merely contains views on the tables in the `public` schema.

### Using `pgroll start` with the `--complete` flag

A migration can be started and completed with one command by specifying the `--complete` flag:

```
$ pgroll start sql/03_add_column.yaml --complete
```

This is equivalent to running `pgroll start` immediately followed by `pgroll complete`.

<Warning>
  Using the `--complete` flag is appropriate only when there are no applications
  running against the old database schema. In most cases, the recommended
  workflow is to run `pgroll start`, then gracefully shut down old applications
  before running `pgroll complete` as a separate step.
</Warning>

## Existing Database Schema

If you attempt to run `pgroll start` against a database that has existing tables but no migration history, the command will fail with an error message. In this case, you should first run `pgroll baseline` to establish a baseline migration that captures the current schema state before starting any new migrations.
